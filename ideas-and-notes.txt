# Ideas

- A favicon for this project. Put it in the root and reference it from every sketch. This will also get rid of the 404 error.
- Video about instance mode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su792jEauZg
- Make a screenshot from every sketch to show in their readmes.
- GUI with sliders, buttons and textfields. For example with firefly-messages: message, number of flies, delays, start recording, etc.
- Learn OBS to create better videos and without having to work around the shortcomings of saveGif. Also to include recordings from my webcam and microphone.
- Learn esbuild or webpack to be able to use typescript. This should improve the code quality and allow for better autocompletion and error detection. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXNsQ4gpMKs
- Create an audio/music visualizer. Like Windows Media Player.

    Make sure to gitignore the music files!
- Learn how to read from the webcam and microphone.


# Notes

- saveGif() seems buggy. Maybe it happens when the background is only drawn in setup() and not in draw(). If it does not render correctly try moving the function call around. Either above or below background(). Or before/after createCanvas(). I haven't found a reliable pattern yet.
- Converting gifs to videos: `ffmpeg -i input.gif -movflags faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4`
See https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/294892. If the gif has sidelengths that are not divisible by 2 then add `-vf "scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2"`.
Alternatively, there are many websites that can convert files for free.
- Creating an animation with saveGif() and deltaTime is buggy. The timing is off, no matter how hard I try to control the frame timing. Seems that I have to set a fixed stepSize between each frame when creating a Gif. I can control the speed of the animation with the stepSize. When printing deltaTime to the console during gif recording it shows all zeros.
- For animations it is sometimes worth it to increase the canvas size to at least 900 and also increase the strokeWeight to make everything more visible.
- Record a video with a height of 1080 px by setting the browser to fullscreen.


# Instagram

- Images should have a sidelength of 1080 pixels, not bigger.
- Videos should have a sidelength of 1080 and have an aspect ration between 16:9 and 9:16. They can be cropped in the upload dialog.
- Thumbnails for reels need to have the aspect ratio 9:16. On the profile page only the center square part of that is shown. For videos that are not 1:1 it's a good idea to take a screenshot and crop it to the necessary aspect ratio.
- Hashtags: #p5js, #creativecoding, #creativecodingart. If it is also generative, then add #generativeart. Generative means that the most important features of the artwork are not determined by a human. Examples: noise2d, perlin-noise-flow-field. Examples for sketches which don't fit this category: epicycles, firefly-messages.
